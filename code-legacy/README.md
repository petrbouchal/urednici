# Code from 2013/2014

This is the code that was used in 2013 to produce calculations and figures for the 2014 publication.

The main thing done here is reading in the data from the mega excel file and generating lots of plots.

I am not proud of this code - it is probably poorly written, clunky, and uses outdated approaches to most everything.

It is probably not easily reproducible either - both because of how it is written and because the paths may not work - it depends on inputs stored in `data-input/legacy` - but all the pieces are there in the directory, so ultimately it should run.
